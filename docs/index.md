## Frequently asked questions

**So, what can I gain through coaching?** 

Coaching results in **having less** of *Fear / Frustration / Doubt / Confusion / Overwhelm / Indecision* and **having more** of *Joy / Confidence / Balance / Peace / Clarity / Action / Time / Fun / Productivity / Freedom / Courage*.

**How will you help me do that?**

In each of our sessions together, I provide a safe and judgement-free zone for you to grow. 
- I listen to you for understanding
- I ask questions that allow you to think in new and revealing ways
- I encourage and champion you every step of the way
- I help you reveal, define and then focus on your true passions and dreams
- I challenge you and hold you to your inner highest standard
- I co-create supportive structures and environments in your life - ones you can count on

**Is this right for me?**

I would love to talk to you if you are
- willing to ask questions and challenge perceptions
- willing to reveal the truth, learn from it and take action
- have a vision, although clouded, for a better life
- have a desire to realize your best!

**Is this therapy?**

No, coaching is not therapy. While both are very valuable in moving you past roadblocks in life, their approaches differ in many ways. Coaching is about taking you from where you are now and moving you forward. Therapy often involves extensively examining your past to define how you got here in the first place. Finally, and foremost, coaches do not diagnose or treat any psychiatric disorders.

**So, is this a course?**

No, coaching is individualised whereas courses are designed in a generic way. We will only talk about you, the unique YOU. I do not claim to be an expert in life to teach you anything. Although, I will provide space for you to be, become and grow as you want to. We together will co-create what YOU need. 

**How long should I expect to need a coach?**

The average amount of time varies based on the situation. I request a 3 month minimum commitment. I find that it allows your success to evolve more rapidly since our relationship has some time to grow. If we are both still benefiting from the relationship, we can keep renewing as you continue on your games of your life.

**How often do we meet?**

We will have 3 or 4 conversations each month, each lasting about 45-50 minutes. We will "book" 60 minutes in the calendar in the event that we need a little extra time.

**I am too busy. I don't know if I can make time for this!**

Book an exploratory conversation with me anyway! Sometimes (dare I say Often), time shortage comes with a lack of clarity and strategy in your dreams. Let us explore together to see how you can create more space for your dreams. Working on YOURSELF is the best investment of your time!
